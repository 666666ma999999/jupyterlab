      " Okay. Yeah, because sometimes when I'm teaching, I like to show pictures. Don't think it doesn't look like Skype has a whiteboard feature. Okay, so one moment. So how have you been? You busy? I'm a little busy. Yeah. How was your week? Now, so my wife go back to her parents to... Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm single right now. Is it enjoyable or is it a little difficult? A little bit difficult. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I make cooking and cleaning the room and wash the clothes. Yeah, I can understand that. When my wife was pregnant, she also went to her hometown. Yeah, yeah. And yeah, I was living single for quite some time actually, because right after that, that's when the pandemic hit. So she was there for, I think, about half a year. Oh, I'm sorry. I was single. I was like, yes, I was living by myself for about half a year. It's very tough, so... Yeah, yeah, it was a real return to, I guess, the life a few years before that. Yeah, because me and her had been... I guess quite a bit of our relationship was long distance. I used to live in Osaka and she used to live in Tokyo. We'd come down every month or so. Yeah. But other than that, everything okay? Work going fine? Okay, thank you. Yeah. Nice, very good. Okay, so I know this is a new format. We'll try our best to work through this naturally. But did you manage to do the homework from some time ago? Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. I have that, yeah. Okay, I believe the homework was polite questions, correct? Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, okay. I write down the chat. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, yeah. Do I just... do I write down the... do I write down, yeah. Yeah, you can copy it into the chat if you want. Yeah, yeah. So just a moment, please. Yeah. I'm just... right now I'm just looking through what kind of things, what kind of features we have here. Okay. Yeah, I'm much more used to Zoom. Okay, okay. May I ask how do you get rid... may I ask how... Okay, so first question, very close. May I ask how you get rid of stress? How you... So in this case, you don't need the do. Do is not needed. How you... ah, do is... okay, okay. Yeah. So let's see here. I see that there are a lot of formatting options, which is nice. Can I ask... so... and then for the second question, can I ask does your wife work now? This is an if question. Can I ask if... Ah, if... can I ask if you like does your wife work now? Yeah, if your wife works now. Ah, okay, thank you. Okay. So, okay, if you like, may I ask how many years have lived in Japan? So in this case, we can... we have to kind of... for the second, the third question, I think we need to choose one of those. If you would like... so could you tell me? Oh. Or may I ask? So in this case, you've got to choose which one you want to use. Oh, thank you. Ah, okay. I see, thank you. Okay. Okay. All right. Do you want to practice asking those questions? Nothing, thank you. No? Everything all right? Okay. Okay. Yeah, so right now, I'm just going to do some real quick formatting just so it makes sense. I say if you could... like instead of if you like, it becomes if you could... could and then may I ask? Okay. So I'm just going to real quick send you the corrections that I have. Okay. Thank you. So yeah, this is pretty much how it would work. Thank you very much. Not a problem. All right. So any other questions about the last lesson? Nothing, thank you. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So polite questions are not easy to do. If the more you practice them, the easier it becomes. So I wouldn't worry too much about it for now. Real quick, I'm just going to reformat my computer. Okay. So... Oh, nice. I guess it shows up on your screen. That's no problem. All right. So today we are moving on to money and numbers. We're going to learn about currency. Oh, lesson 22. Lesson 22. Yes. Yeah. There's an unfortunate side effect of online lessons is that I do not have the worksheets with me. So what we are going to do is we're going to learn a little bit about currency, money, as well as numbers just from scratch. The good news is I have taught this quite a few times before. Okay. So this isn't the first time we've talked a little bit about... I've talked or taught about money. So it should be fine. So let me real quick ask you, what kind of currency do you know about? Oh, currency. I'm going to list some in the chat as you talk. So of course there is the Japanese. Japanese yen. Very good. US dollar. US dollar. And UK pound. UK pound. And Euro. And Euro. Yeah. Do you think of anything else? Australia dollar. Yeah, Australian dollar. Okay. So dollars are quite gone. Now, today we will maybe focus on two or three of those currencies and then we're going to maybe practice numbers as well as talk about prices. Sound okay? Okay. All right. So which one would you like to work with first? Of course, I'm most familiar with the US dollar, but we can try for the others. US dollar. Yeah. Okay. So the US dollars has quite a few different denotations. There's words. What are the types of dollar or money that you can hold in the United States? What's the type of money? So there are of course coins. Coins? What else? Build. Build. Bills. There's another term for bills. Do you know what they're called? Starts with an N. A cent? Cent is one is the one singular unit. The one cent or cents. But there are bills. Sometimes they're called notes. Notes? Yes, notes. Oh, I don't know. Sometimes in slang people will call them bucks. Bucks. B-C-A. Yeah. Bucks. B-U-C-K. B-U-C-K. Yeah. Bucks. There's actually quite a lot of slang terms you can use. Sorry. Let me just mute that. But yeah, there is a lot. If you listen to American music, you'll hear that they use quite a lot of different terms. Sometimes people will say green for very high level money. It's sometimes called Benjamins. Why do you think it would be called Benjamins? Oh, I know. So one Benjamin is the term for $100. Oh, very expensive. That's because Benjamin Franklin is the face on the top, on the front. Oh, I see. Yeah. But it's not very common. People say it maybe as a joke or in like music. Yeah. Japanese is the same. Yukichi-Fukuzawa. Yeah. So like I think it's pretty universal that the United States, not just the United States, but people will give like joke terms to their money. But there are also different terms for the coins. So as you mentioned, there is the one cent. One cent is called a certain, it has a certain name. Do you know what it's called? One cent. A one cent, like that one brown coin. Do you know what that's called? It's called a penny. Penny? Yeah. They're not very common. People are actually considering getting rid of the penny because they are, because most people are switching over to e-money. But yes, there's the penny. What do you think is the next number? So there's the one coin. What do you think comes after that? One coin. Yeah, the one coin is the penny. The one cent coin. What do you think is the next coin is worth? So in Japan, it's one. Actually no, it's five. Five cents. Five cents. You know what five cents is called? Oh, I don't know. It's called the nickel. Nickel? Nickel. Okay, okay. The name is made of nickel? I believe it used to be. Now it's made out of, I think just metal. But yeah, the pennies, penny was a term for copper at one point. That's why it's called, I believe that's why it's called the penny. Yes, nickels used to, I believe, be made of nickel. So after that, you were correct. There's ten cents. Ten cents is how much, what do you think it is? Do you know the name? Ten cents. The ten cent is called the dime. D-I-M-E, yes. And interestingly enough, it's the smallest. Dimes. So it's the smallest in size. It's called a dime. Oh, dimes. Oh, thank you. Now the next one is probably what's most different from Japan. What do you think is the next one after ten cents? The next step up. Fifty cents. Fifty cents is actually very rare. It's very uncommon. That is, so fifty cents is the half dollar coin. And it's not common. It's very hard to find. In fact, some people collect them so that they can sell them for more because they are that rare. Although it's technically illegal to do that. But there is one before that and that is twenty five cents. Twenty five? Yes. What do you think this is called? So the fifty cents is the half dollar. What do you think the twenty five cents is? Quarter. Yes, the quarter. It's just called the quarter. Quarter. Yes. So those are the denominations of the money currency in the United States. So let's see if we can challenge ourselves a little bit. I'm going to say a number and I would like you to tell me how many coins that is. Okay. I'm going to write down that. Okay. So let's see here. Twelve cents. Twelve cents is how many coins? Twelve cents, how many coins? So that is how many pennies, nickels, dimes. Okay. You get to choose. One dime and two pennies. Yes, very, very good. Okay. How about fifty six cents? Half dollar coin and one nickel and one penny. Yep, very good. Once again, just like to mention that the half dollar is very rare. Okay. But that's fine. Yeah. So in this case, it would probably be two quarters. Two quarters is common than half dollar coin? Yes, quarters are much more common than half dollars. Okay. At least when I was living in the States, they were not common at all. I think I held a quarter or a half dollar coin twice in my life. They're that rare. They're almost as rare as two thousand yen notes. Yeah, they're almost as rare as those. Okay, okay, okay. I see, thank you. So let's try this one. Three quarters. Yes, very, very good. Okay, and then let's try one more. Thirty four cents. One quarter and nine pennies. Oh, nice. Yeah, that was very good. I was actually thinking of that. Yeah, that works. Excellent. Okay, so we've learned a few of the cents, but now let's learn about the notes. Okay, so notes are just the term for bills. Again, you can use bills interchangeably. But what, so the first one, one is of course, the one note, one note, first is one dollar. One dollar equals, of course, this. So how many, what is the next step above one dollar? What do you think? Ten dollars. Five dollars. No, there's actually something in between one and five. There is, there is two dollars. Two dollars. There's a two dollar note. Yeah, that one is also quite common. So then of course, yeah, you are right, there is a five dollar note. Next is ten dollars. Yes, ten dollars. Ten dollar note. What do you think comes after ten? Twenty five. No, in this case, it's actually twenty. Twenty dollars. Oh, thank you, Doros. Okay, and then next up, there's, I'm wondering why there isn't, if there's a twenty, that's kind of confusing. You bring that up a good point. There is a twenty five coin, but there's not twenty five dollars. Okay, yeah. Okay, next is fifty. Fifty, very good. Fifty dollars. Fifty dollar note, okay. And I'm not sure if the, I have to double check, but what do you think comes after that? One hundred. One hundred, yes. Okay, I'm going to look up US currency on my phone real quick. Because I believe there is something more than the one hundred dollar. One hundred dollars. I'm pretty sure there is a two hundred. I just need to make sure, because the currency in the United States kind of confuses me a little bit. Yeah, so different, easy, different. Yeah. Not easy, different, yeah. Oh yeah, so let's see here. There is... Yeah, so there are some that are still in existence that are much bigger. There is the five hundred. So these are rarely used. Oh, five hundred. Five hundred, one thousand, fifty thousand, and ten thousand. Now one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to strike through the ten thousand one, because they aren't... It still exists, but they're not making them anymore. Oh, thank you. Yeah, so a lot of the ones that they say are rarely used, that means they're not very commonly used in person. They are more commonly used in banks. Yeah, so for bank trading and things like that, they're generally not used much anymore. Now, I should note that there are more coins. There are dollar coins. Yes, they are very rare. They are not very... they are not quite commonly used. There is the... yes, there's the dollar coin. The... let's see here. There's a... surprisingly enough, there's a half cent. Half cent? Yes, I've never seen it. There is the five dollar coin, the ten dollar coin, and the twenty dollar coin. Now, this is important to note. There is a term called legal tender. You know what this means? Legal tender and illegal tender. Oh, legal tender. No, I don't know. So, tender is the process in which money is used. So, if something is legal tender, it means it can be processed. What do you think illegal tender means? Oh, the fake. Fake, yes. It means it is something called counterfeit. Counterfeit? Counterfeit is the term for fake money. Yeah. So, all of the money I have mentioned... is legal tender, meaning you can use it. It's just very rare. Some of these... So, do you know what the process of making money is called? Oh. Of course, people can't make... I'm talking about... Do you know how banks make... physically make money? Do you know what it's called? Oh. Oh, I don't know. It's not very common, but it is important to note it's called minting. Minting? Yeah, minting. Ah, minting. Yes. So, the... I believe the building in Tokyo, or maybe even in Osaka, that makes the money, physically makes the money, but it's called the mint. The mint office. And it has... it's called mint because the green that they use is special. Oh, thank you. Yeah, no problem. All right. So, in order to talk about money, we do have to think about how money is changed. So, if you make money from the US to Japan or Japan to the US, what do you need to look at? What is the term for that? Oh... So... Exchange rate. Exchange rate. Yes, exchange rate. You know what the exchange rate for the US dollar to Japanese yen is right now? I think one dollar is 132 Japanese yen. Right. That's double. Yeah, very good. Yeah, you had it right. Almost exact. That is correct. Exchange rate is up down so... current. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It changes quite a lot. Now, let's see here. I don't think we have to do too much of that, but there are exchange rates and then there are transfer fees and there's a lot of other terms that you need to think about when it comes to that. But those are the two words I would think of when it comes to money. So we've talked a little bit about the United States currency. Do you have any questions about US currency as it stands? Yeah, no, thank you. No? Okay. So let's move on to talking about money or numbers then. Okay? Okay. So a lot of the times when we talk about numbers, there are terms that are used to consider value. For example, do you know what... so we mentioned cents. Cents. Do you know why it's called a cent? One cent? I don't know. It's because one is one of 100. So the cent equals 100. So a centimeter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So 100 years is a century. Century. Yeah. These are, I believe, originally Latin or Greek terms, but there are a lot more. Do you know any others? So what do you think is ten then? Or sorry, ten. Ten. Do you know? Ten, yes. So 100 is centi or centi. Do you know what ten is? Noz. Noz. Not quite. It's decade. So... So... It's decim... Decimeter. Decimeter. Ah, decimeter. Yes. Sometimes you hear deca. Deca might be a little bit different, but decimeters. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go back to simpler numbers then. One. What do you think one is sometimes called? One? Yes. One... This one's hot. This one has... there's two terms actually. Single? Not quite. There is mono. Mono. Ah, mono. Ah. Yeah. Like sometimes if you're making TKG, you will add a certain spice. It's called an anus sodium glutamate. Yeah. One sodium. If you have speakers in your house, if you're only using one sound, that's called mono. Mono. And then if there's two, it's stereo. That's the setting. The other one is uni. Ah, uni. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So universe. Yeah. Unicycle. Unique. Unique. Unique. Yes. One of a kind. Very good. Four of a kind. Yes. Now, how about the next one? So uni and mono mean one. Do you know what two is? There's one... There's different term for each of them. Two. Ah. Think about the thing that you ride. So, um, I rode this to the station the other day. It has two wheels. What is it called? Two wheels. Two wheels. Two wheels. You can ride it like this. What do you think it's called? The bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Ah, bicycle. Bye. Bye. Bye. Ah, bicycle. Bye. Ah, bicycle. Do you know what the original term for glasses was? Do you know what there... It was called bifocals. Bifocals. Oh. Yep. If you go to the United States, sometimes you hear glasses store. Sometimes you hear the term bifocals. Bifocals. Oh. Because they're meant to focus your eyes. Oh. Oh. Oh, this is one. Sometimes if you watch romance or old stories, you'll see people with one glasses right here. Do you know what that's called? That's not called bifocals. It's called a monofocals. Yeah. Mono. What? Monocals. Monocals. Monocals. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Okay. So we know uni by what you think is the third one. This is one most people know. Ah. Okay. Ah, tori. Try. Yes, very good. Tree is fine too. So if a bicycle has two wheels, what is something that has three wheels? Ah. Ah. Bicycle. Bicycle. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori. Okay. So most of them will have two small wheels attached. That's called the tricycle mode. Tricycle. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Sometimes there are bikes that have two wheels. Those are called tricycles. Ah. So our latest feature, my daughter took three square, three square. Tricycle. Yeah. Oh. My son doesn't like riding a bike yet. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. It's okay. So, here's one. Triangle. Triangle. Triangle. Triangle. Triangle. Yep. Three angles. Triangle. Triangle. Excellent. Oh. So when someone has two children at once, that's called twins, right? Twins. Ah, twins. What do you think it is when someone has three children at once? This one is called triplets. Triplets. Oh. Triplets. Yeah. Oh, this means a birthday is same three children. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So someone is carrying three children. Someone is carrying three children. Yeah. They're barely. They're going to have triple trouble. Triplets. Oh. Triplets. Yes. Triplets. Yeah. Okay. Now. Four is probably the next one. Four is probably the last one most people use. There are more after this, but four is one, two, three are common. Four is sometimes used. Oh. Do you know what four is? Four is B. B. Not quite. Four. B. I. is two. Two. So Q. U. A. B. Quad. Quad is four. Oh, quad. Oh. So do you remember why it's called quarter? Oh, quarter. Oh, quarter. Oh, quarter. Yeah. Because it's one fourth, right? Quarter. Quad. Oh, I see. Okay. A square. Square. It's sometimes called the square, yes. But any shape that has four sides is called a quadrangle. Quadrangle. Quadrangle. Quadrangle. Quadrangle. Ah. No. It's not used too commonly. There are rectangles. Rectangles is another word and like others. But yeah, quadrangle shapes. Okay, okay, okay. Quad. Quadrangle is a, have four, four angle. But so. Four. Four angle. But square is same and line, four line is same. Yeah. So on square is a type of quadrangle. Quadrangle. Yeah. Quadrangle is, ah, quad, quadrangle's line, line's long, length is different. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So quadrangle is a category. And then the square and rectangle and parallelogram, these are types of quadrangle. So quadrangle is the big category. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. I just think. Yeah. So quad, okay. Quad is not used too often. Sometimes you hear a quart. Cool. So a quart is a, I think, one fourth of a liter. Yeah. So a quart. Oh, liter. It might be one fourth of a liter or it's one fourth of a pint. I'm sorry. I don't know. The imperial system confuses me too. Okay. Let's see here. Ah, a quad bike. Quad bike. This is really, really strange. Something being called a quad bike. But a quad bike is a motor bike that has four wheels. Oh, I have never seen it. They're not very common in Japan, but they're sometimes used for off-road cycling in the United States and other countries. They're like motorbikes, but they have big wheels and they're meant to climb on mountains. I heard so it's very stable driving. Yeah. They're fairly stable. I've seen people fall off of them. Yeah. You gotta be careful because those things are pretty powerful. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Okay. So we're not going to really go through the next ones, but I'm just going to tell you what they are. Triplets. Queen is five. Queen. Oh, queen. Oh. Yeah. So, oh yeah, if you're having, if after triplets, if you have four children, which is very rare, that's quit, that's quadruplets. Quadruplets, yeah. Quadruplets. There's quit and tuplets. Quit and tuplets. Yeah, I see. Thank you. Yeah. And then there are a few more, but you don't really need to know them. If you're really into math, you can learn all of the terms for it. Beyond five, there's not really many. Yeah. There is sept, which is seven. There is octo. Oh yeah, that's one. Octo. Octo. You know octo? Octo. There's an animal that's very similar to this. Eight. Yep, octo is eight. Octopus. Yeah, those are the ones that, those are really the only ones most people know. There are a lot of others, but now we're going to get, and the last one we're going to do is we're going to do the hundreds. So we already know ten, which is deca, one hundred, which is senty, or senty. What is one thousand? One thousand. Yes. One thousand. Oh, this is million. Millions. Oh, million. Yeah, million. Mill, millimetres. Millennium. Millenium. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so those are the ones that you only, those are really the only ones you need to know. There are a lot others, there are many others, more than I know actually. If you're really into math, it's kind of cool to learn, but generally speaking you don't need to know it. Well thank you. Now, let's learn about counting money though. Counting money has names. This is where it's kind of important to know beyond million. Okay, so this is where, all right, so I'm going to show you a number and I would like you to read it. How much is this? One thousand. Yes. How much is this? Oh, billion. No, no, no, one hundred thousand. Yes, excellent. Very, very good. Okay. So the thing that can give you a hint is when you see a comma, that's where you have to say a thousand. Okay, okay, okay. So ignore, like read the number and then that's the comma is where you add a thousand or something. Okay, so now let's do this one. Two millions. Okay. Okay, try this one. Oh, three millions, 40,000. Excellent. Very good. Okay, now we're going to make it a little bit more challenging. Okay. Okay, five million, two millions, 30,000. Okay, excellent. Very, very good. Okay. Okay, last but not least, this one is going to be a quite intense number. Oh. Okay, here we go. Yes, so this is as far as you will need to know. I know a thousand. Next is? Million, billion. Okay, two trillion. Okay. Very good. Two trillion and seven hundred billion, three hundred million and fifty seven thousand. Yes, very, very good. Oh, thank you. Yeah, so really there is, again, after that would be quadrillion. Quadrillion. Yes, after that would be quadrillion. But you don't need to know that. Really, really. Trillion is the last number of people use generally when it comes to counting. So, yeah, so if you do want to learn more, I would recommend actually looking up stock prices of things or luxury items. Oh. So, optional homework. I'm going to write this down. Yeah. Look up the prices for, look up the prices for two luxury items. Hello. Hello. I'm just giving him an optional homework right now. Yeah. So, look up the prices for two luxury items and then look up the prices for, or, sorry, I'm just giving an optional homework to Masaki. Look up the, actually I'm going to say look up the size, the dimensions of an item in your house. In your house. Two items. Two items. So, do you know what dimensions are? Oh. That means width, length, and height. Oh, rather. Because that will get you to practice decimeters, centimeters, and millimeters. That sound okay? Okay. All right. Do you have any questions? Sorry, we're running a little bit over time. Yeah, nothing. Thank you. Yeah. Everything good? Yeah. All right. Well, thank you very much. I hope that you learned a lot this lesson. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me next time. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. No problem. I'll see you next time, right? See you next time. Bye. Bye. Thank you. I'm going to say goodbye. Yeah.\n"
